slow_conv2d_cpu" not implemented for 'Half'
when dtype=float16
apparently this is caused by not using GPU:

solution: do BLIP but not with fp16

RuntimeError: "LayerNormKernelImpl" not implemented for 'Half'

possibly caused by use mixed precision when it should be full precision

problem:
RuntimeError: element 0 of tensors does not require grad and does not have a grad_fn

solution:
might be a problem with adamW optimizer
/home/jlb638/.conda/envs/clip/lib/python3.11/site-packages/trl/trainer/ddpo_trainer.py L398 
change to adam optimizer
